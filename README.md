# twomt_tinker
Our first steps into OSS and modding for minetest.

After Hacktoberfest got us into the mood for open source, we decided to do something in our off-work tinkertime that we share with the world.

That's why we ended up here, trying to write a mod (which may or may not have any actual gameplay use) for minetest and learn what we can on the way.
